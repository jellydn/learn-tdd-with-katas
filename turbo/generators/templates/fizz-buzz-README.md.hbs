# TDD Kata: FizzBuzz

Welcome to the FizzBuzz TDD Kata. This exercise will help you learn and practice Test Driven Development (TDD) principles with a simple problem.

## Problem Description

The `fizzBuzz()` function will follow these rules:

1. It takes an integer N and prints integers 1 to N.

2. It prints "Fizz" if an integer is divisible by 3.

3. It prints "Buzz" if an integer is divisible by 5.

4. It prints "FizzBuzz" if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Examples

```javascript
console.log(fizzBuzz(1)); // Output: '1'
console.log(fizzBuzz(3)); // Output: 'Fizz'
console.log(fizzBuzz(5)); // Output: 'Buzz'
console.log(fizzBuzz(15)); // Output: 'FizzBuzz'
```

## Testing

To execute the tests:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

## Methodology

This kata follows TDD principles:

1. Write a failing test for a feature.
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code, ensuring to keep all tests green.

Remember to keep your tests as simple as possible and write just enough code to make them pass.
