# TDD Kata: String Calculator

Welcome to the String Calculator TDD Kata. This is a simple yet powerful exercise to learn and practice Test Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Problem Description

The String Calculator function, `add()`, has the following specifications:

1. It will take 0, 1, or 2 numbers in a string and will return their sum. For an empty string, it will return 0. For example: "" => 0, "1" => 1, "1,2" => 3.

2. It can handle an unknown amount of numbers.

3. It can handle new lines between numbers. For example: "1\n2,3" => 6.

4. It supports different delimiters. To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]" For example: "//;\n1;2" => 3.

## Examples

```javascript
console.log(add("")); // Output: 0
console.log(add("1")); // Output: 1
console.log(add("1,2")); // Output: 3
console.log(add("1\n2,3")); // Output: 6
console.log(add("//;\n1;2")); // Output: 3
```

## Testing

To execute the tests:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

## Methodology

This kata follows TDD principles:

1. Write a failing test for a feature.
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code, ensuring to keep all tests green.

Remember to keep your tests as simple as possible and write just enough code to make them pass.
