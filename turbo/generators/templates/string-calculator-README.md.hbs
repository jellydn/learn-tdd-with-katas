## TDD Kata: String Calculator

Learning TDD can be effectively supplemented with the use of coding katas. They are small, repeatable problems that are meant to practice programming.

### Problem Description

1. The String Calculator function, `add()`, will take 0, 1, or 2 numbers in a string and will return their sum. For an empty string, it will return 0. For example: "" => 0, "1" => 1, "1,2" => 3.

2. The `add()` function will handle an unknown amount of numbers.

3. The `add()` function will handle new lines between numbers. For example: "1\n2,3" => 6.

4. The `add()` function will support different delimiters. To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]" For example: "//;\n1;2" => 3.
